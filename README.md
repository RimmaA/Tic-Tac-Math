# Tic-Tac-Math
This programimplements Tic-Tac-Math game.
Tic-Tac-Math is a lot like Tic-Tac-Toe. The game is played on a 3x3 grid;
players take turns marking one cell at a time. The difference is that instead
of placing Xs and Os on the grid, the players place the numbers 1 to 9. And,
instead of trying to make a row, column, or diagonal filled with 3 Xs or 3
Os, the players try to make a row, column, or diagonal whose cells sum to
15. One wrinkle: each number can only be placed ONCE.
