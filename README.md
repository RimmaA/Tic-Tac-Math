RULES:

This is a two-player game. Each player has a field which is a one-dimensional array.
 
The length of the board 64. 

Each player has a collection of beds of various lengths, such as 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (the two players have the same set of bed sizes); 

Before play begins, the players place their beds on their field.

They can do it randomly or by yourself.

In each turn, a player names a position (roughly, an index in the opponent’s board).

If a target is occupying that position on the opponent’s board, the opponent says “ATE”; if not, the opponent says “MISS”. 

When all positions on a field have been EATEN, the opponent gives a message that you ate all carrots. 

The winner of the game is the player to first eliminate all the opponent’s carrots.
